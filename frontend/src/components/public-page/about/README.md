# About page–specific sections

These sections are used **only** on the About page. Content is editable from **Admin → Public Pages → About** (page type “About”).

- **AboutMissionSection** – Mission block (title + optional description or default content).
- **AboutCoreValuesSection** – Three value cards (section title, subtitle, icon/title/description per card).
- **AboutSafeguardingSection** – Safeguarding block (title, subtitle, description, badges).

For other pages (e.g. Home), add a new folder under `public-page/` (e.g. `public-page/home/`) with that page’s specific sections.
