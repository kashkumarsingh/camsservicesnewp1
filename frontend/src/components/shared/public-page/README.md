# Common (shared) public page components

Use these on **any** public page (About, Home, Contact, etc.) for consistent layout.

- **PageHero** – Hero with optional video, title, subtitle, and children (e.g. CTA buttons).
- **RichTextBlock** – Renders CMS rich-text (HTML or Markdown) with prose styling.

Add more common blocks here when multiple pages need the same pattern.
